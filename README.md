# CSV File Merger using Tkinter

## Installation
```
pip install pandas
pip install Pypubsub
```
## Implementation

This app was built using Tkinter for the GUI, pandas for the csv merge,
duplicate record removal, and sorting.

Pypubsub is used to send messages between frames when the files
have been successfully merged and when the views need to be changed.

_This app was built for Tkinter practice_
